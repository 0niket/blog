Big projects carry inherent risks. What if you invest months in building something, only to discover that customers are not using it? I have witnessed this phenomenon negatively impacting team morale on multiple occasions throughout my career. It also puts leaders in a difficult position, as they must support a team that is not producing any value for the company over multiple quarters. Ultimately, these are all indications that such projects can be detrimental to the company, regardless of the scale of the resulting damage.

While working on a project, we had to determine the strategy to address these issues. The solution we discovered can be summarised in one line: *"Deliver value to customers in small increments.‚Äù*

Let's break it down. First is having early adopters for the feature, second is delivering value, and the third is doing it in small increments rather than doing a big bang release.

Let's look at each one of it.

### Early adopters

If you have an idea that needs to be turned into a product, the most important thing is to find customers who are eager or at least interested in having it. These customers are usually enthusiastic about having this feature in your product, which is why they will be supportive throughout the process. It's important to ensure that you are solving a common use case by having more than one early adopter. In our case, having five early adopters worked well.

The next step is to establish a regular and timely cadence with these customers. Initially, the main purpose of these meetings is to validate the **riskiest hypothesis** *\[1\]* about the project. Later on, these meetings can also be used for onboarding and gathering feedback.

### Delivering Value

Delivering value to customers means that each release of the project should have a measurable impact or benefit associated with it. For example, this could include an increase in earnings, a reduction in costs, an improvement in customer satisfaction ratings (CSAT), or an increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS). While the value delivered may not always be immediately apparent, it is important to track and ask relevant questions to understand the impact. By consistently delivering value with each release, it becomes easier for the team and leaders to justify the project's cost and demonstrate its worth.

### Small releases

Handling engineering complexity and team management are two main aspects to consider when it comes to small releases.

Engineering Complexity

Introducing meaningful milestones throughout the project helps reduce code conflicts with the rest of the engineering team. By keeping the feature branch close to the master, the engineering team stays updated with the work, facilitating manageable changes in the development, test, & production environments.

Utilise **feature flags** *\[2\]* to enable the feature only for early adopters. In situations where delivering value with each release is not feasible or where there may be concerns about the stability or impact of a feature, **rollout flags** provide a way to mitigate risks. By rolling out feature only for a specific set of users or a percentage of the user base, the impact of any potential issues or bugs can be limited.

Team Management

Small releases are way to keep your team flexible, reduce team fatigue as achieving small & meaningful milestones are encouraging and give sense of accomplishment. Flexibility can come handy while addressing other burning issues within the team.
